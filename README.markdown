# Ghost Attributes!

This is a silly example of how you can mimic attr\_accessor using closures
instead of instance variables. I wrote this gem to play with some ideas from
Paolo Perotta's book, [Metaprogramming
Ruby](http://pragprog.com/titles/ppmetr/metaprogramming-ruby).

## To install: 
gem install ghost\_attributes
